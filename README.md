Context: Major League Baseball (MLB)  teams generate between 30-45% of their revenues from ticket sales, concessions, and parking1. Unfortunately, there are some ballclubs that almost always have below-average attendance figures. It is assumed that the more a team wins, the more fans will come to the game. However, there have been teams that have successful seasons and still fail to bring in average-to-above-average sized crowds. Is it possible that some baseball franchises are operating in geographic markets that make it very hard to have normal attendance figures? If so, which teams would benefit the most from moving to another city and which city would maximize their attendance? 

Problem Statement: By creating a regression model for team attendance on a season basis, which, if any, MLB team would benefit the most from relocating to a new city and which city would maximize their attendance?

The 30 Major League Baseball Stadiums, Ranked

Best of the Ballparks MLB Rankings: 2019

Americans agree: The ideal temperature is in the 70s

Constraints: 1994 Players Strike canceled most of the season and this could skew some data. Data is only for total attendance at the end of the regular season rather than on a game basis. It may prove difficult to determine with confidence which new MLB cities would boost attendance figures. The economic and demographic data I have are only from one point of time and could be greatly different and skew results if applied to MLB seasons many years ago. Ballpark rankings are only for parks currently in use.
